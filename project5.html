			<h2> Our Target Community </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Our target community is primarily students, staff, and faculty on the U of M campus.
                    With this being said, Wolverguard aims to extend its reach beyond the campus boundaries and be accessible to and utilized by all individuals in the Ann Arbor
                    community and the surrounding area. This inclusivity promotes a collaborative approach to public safety, involving not just the university community but also the broader local community.
                    </br>
					Our app, Wolverguard, provides users with a sense of security by offering immediate access to emergency services (e.g., DPSS) and the ability to report incidents quickly. Real-time alerts and notifications keep them informed about potential dangers, allowing them to stay vigilant and make informed decisions for their personal safety.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h2> Problem </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Safety on campus has been a growing concern at the University of Michigan. Recently, there has been a significant increase in crime incidents and reports on campus, making it crucial for college students to prioritize their safety and well-being. Feeling safe on campus is not just a privilege but a fundamental right every student deserves. Users need real-time crime notifications to ensure they are aware of any danger in the area. </br>
                    On average, the Division of Public Safety & Security (DPSS) at the University of Michigan responds to more than 120,000 calls for service (CFS) per year, which is equivalent to over 300 CFS per day. </br>
                    Additionally, according to the DPSS website, there were 1,853 individuals arrested over four years from 2017 to 2020. These figures highlight the urgency of addressing the safety concerns on campus and implementing effective measures to ensure the protection and well-being of all students.
				</p>
			</div>

            <h2> Solution </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					WolverGuard offers a comprehensive solution to address safety concerns on campus. The app keeps users informed about potential risks, emergencies, or safety concerns in their vicinity. By delivering timely crime alerts, the app allows users to make informed decisions, take necessary precautions, and stay aware to ensure their personal safety. </br>
                    Furthermore, Wolverguard allows for a direct line to contact DPSS, real-time crime alerts, Blue Light Phone locations, transportation via SafeRide, and a crime reporting feature. By utilizing this app, students are empowered and contribute to the collective safety and security of the entire campus community.
				</p>

			<h2> Mockups </h2>
			<div>
				<h3>Home and Signup (Login) Page</h3>
				<p>
					The app uses the University of Michigan's signature colors of blue and maize as the primary colors, with gray and red used for accents. These colors are chosen because they are quickly and easily identifiable by users and have a high color contrast ratio of 9.74:1, making them accessible to people with visual impairments.
                    </br>University of Michigan community members can
                    sign up and log in to the app using their
                    university-issued email addresses. Non-Umich
                    users can sign up and log in using the standard
                    and universal sign-up/login page, but they
                    must provide a government-issued ID. This is
                    done to prevent fraudulent reports.
                     </br>
                    <div class="project_five_one">
                        <img src="images/project5-8.png" alt="Umich Login">
                        <img src="images/project5-3.png" alt="Non-Umich Singup">
                        <img src="images/project5-2.png" alt="Non-Umich Login">
                    </div>
				</p>
				<h3>Data Sharing Permissions</h3>
				<p>
					When users log in to the app, they are prompted to allow the app to access their location data. This is necessary so that the safety departments can quickly identify the location of users reporting or experiencing an emergency. </br>
                    Notifications can be customized to meet the needs of users. However, users are required to receive notifications for crime and emergency reports. Crime reports are sent to users after the safety departments have gathered detailed information about the incident, so they may take some time to reach users. Emergency reports are sent to users within a one-mile radius of the location where the report was made and do not contain any detailed information. </br>

                    </div>
				</p>
				<h3>Emergency Report Buttons</h3>
				<p>
					It incorporates basic circular icons with clearly defined words and symbols, making it easy for users to choose the appropriate button for their situation.</br>
                    We have identified three common types on campus for emergencies: actual assailant, sexual crisis, and health emergency. To address these emergencies, we have created dedicated buttons for each type, allowing users to contact the departments responsible for promptly handling these issues. In addition to the emergency buttons, we have included a separate button that directs users to a report form for non-emergency situations. </br>
                    We have implemented a safeguard mechanism to prevent accidental button presses from triggering reports. Users must either press and hold or triple-click the buttons to initiate the reporting process. </br>

				</p>
				<h3>Map</h3>
				<p>
					The map displays the locations of the blue light emergency phones on campus. These phones are essential contact points during emergencies, and we understand the significance of quickly identifying their locations. To accomplish this, we utilize blue markers on the map to clearly indicate the presence of these emergency phones. </br>
                    The map showcases the user's current location. To ensure visibility and ease of identification, we utilize the color maize to represent the user's current location. This enables users to quickly and accurately identify their position relative to the surrounding environment.</br>
                    Map utilizes red to indicate areas where crime is most likely to occur. By highlighting these high-risk areas, users can exercise caution and be more mindful of their surroundings when navigating through such locations. </br>
                    <img src="images/project5-9.png" alt="Five options to report emergency" class="alone">
				</p>
				<h3>Alert/Notifications</h3>
				<p>
					Users have the ability to access and review alerts they have received. This feature lets users stay updated on important safety notifications or advisories relevant to their campus or surrounding area. Users can directly call the Department of Public Safety and Security (DPSS) or report incidents online. </br>
                    To address the safety concerns of users traveling late at night, we have incorporated a convenient feature that allows users to call SafeRide directly from the app. The DPSS news section contains valuable safety tips, updates, and other relevant information from the Department of Public Safety and Security. </br>
                    The aesthetic and minimalist design explicitly shows all of the options to users. The navigation bar consists of three icons: a map, home, and alert, allowing user control and freedom over page navigation. To provide users with explicit feedback on their current page, the icons are filled with a distinct color, specifically 'maize' (yellow). This visual indication enables users to quickly identify which page they are currently on and easily navigate the app.</br>

			<h2> Information Analysis: Collecting Data </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Our app gathers essential data to ensure the best possible experience for and enhance public safety on the UM campus. Some critical data that we collect include basic user details like name, contact information, and location to provide personalized services and accurate emergency responses. By obtaining real-time location data, we can quickly locate users during emergencies or when they need assistance. Users can report incidents such as accidents or crimes through the app, and we collect incident details like location, time, description, and any photos or videos that users would provide. We also collect communication logs (with privacy in mind) to monitor, maintain quality, and support investigations.</br>

					To gather data, users may be prompted to provide this information manually or automatically collects some data with permissions, like location data using GPS or other location services on their device.</br>
				</p>
			</div>
			<h2> Information Analysis: Analyzing Data </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					The user profile information we collect is utilized to offer personalized services and deliver relevant information based on their preferences and current location. In emergencies, the app leverages real-time location data to determine the user's whereabouts accurately, facilitating prompt assistance. This data is securely shared with DPSS, enabling them to respond swiftly and effectively when needed.
					</br>
					DPSS can utilize the app's crime reporting feature to conduct checks to ensure accuracy and reliable information. The app's map feature displays the reported crimes and emergency button usage, visually representing safety incidents within specific areas. This will allow users and DPSS to identify areas with higher crime than others. By analyzing the frequency, type, time, and location of reported crimes, WolverGuard helps identify potential patterns and trends, aiding in developing crime prevention strategies. This data analysis is crucial in enhancing public safety efforts and creating a safer community on campus. </br>

				</p>
			</div>
			<h2> Information Analysis: Storing Data </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					Ensuring the storage of data on WolverGuard maintains user safety and privacy is paramount. While DPSS will have access to user information, we ensure user anonymity is maintained within the campus community. Data encryption and stringent access controls are implemented to protect stored information and safeguard user privacy. Moreover, we adhere to a carefully crafted data retention policy that removes certain types of information after a designated period, minimizing unnecessary data storage. Our commitment to user safety and privacy extends to protecting vulnerable populations within the UMich campus community. The app will strictly follow legal and ethical guidelines, employ any necessary security measures, and conduct regular privacy audits to ensure the highest level of data protection. 
				</p>
			</div>
            <h2>Why our App is better</h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					WolverGuard is better than the existing UM Public Safety application in several key aspects. Our app features an interactive map displaying the location of reported crimes and Blue Light Phones, allowing users to make informed decisions and easily access emergency communication. We also prioritize usability by incorporating Nielsen's heuristics, ensuring an intuitive and accessible user interface. With its map feature, including Blue Light Phone locations, and a user interface designed with Nielsen's usability heuristics, WolverGuard outshines the existing UM Public Safety application. The app offers an enhanced user experience that provides valuable information and resources in a visually engaging and user-friendly manner. By utilizing WolverGuard, college students can take control of their safety, stay informed about crime incidents, and swiftly reach out to DPSS when necessary.

				</p>

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>
			<div>
				<p>
					WolverGuard is designed to aid and enhance the safety and security of the University of Michigan's campus. Our app comprises comprehensive features such as alerts, immediate emergency services (DPSS) access, a map with nearby crimes and Blue Light Phone locations, a user reporting feature, and SafeRide.
